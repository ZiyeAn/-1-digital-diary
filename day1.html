        What a rollercoaster today. I started with an online transfer of $26,242.45 into my checking account from savings. I felt rich for a brief moment. Then, of course, I transferred $10,000 right back out to savings. I can’t help but think of it as a safety net. After that, Netflix charged me $7.61, a small but steady reminder of modern life. The day ends with my balance at $16,234.84—more manageable after that big deposit.

        Today felt heavier with payments. Mint Mobile charged $113.78, and Apple took its recurring $5.99. I feel like these recurring payments are sneaking up on me. It’s funny, but I sometimes lose track of them, even though I know they’re coming. The balance is now at $16,115.07. I guess it could be worse.

        Verizon struck again with the usual $49.99 payment. Honestly, I should shop around for a better plan; it’s adding up. With this, my balance is down to $16,065.08.

        Made a couple of small purchases today, though they add up. First, I used my card for Mobile Suica in Tokyo for $13.56, which I didn’t mind, but then there was a foreign exchange rate adjustment fee of $0.40. Small, but still, I wish I had paid more attention to that. These little things bring my balance down to $16,050.13.

        Today has been quite a day financially, but at least I got a nice boost. Jingyi Zhou sent me a Zelle payment of $16,248.13, which I’ve been waiting for. The balance shot back up to $16,248.13 after that. It felt good seeing that number, especially after all the small purchases I’ve been making. But then, I found myself quickly dipping again.

        I had to take care of a few things today. First, there was a $39.95 charge for WiFi onboard during a flight—it was necessary for work. After that, I took a Lyft ride that set me back $35.96. Running errands later in the day got me into trouble—an impulsive Ikea trip cost me $345.43, and there was a $104.00 charge from the MTA for a PATH Smartcard. My balance sank to $15,722.79 by the end of the day.
        
        It’s funny how fast the money moves, but I’m glad for that big transfer earlier. Otherwise, I’d be in panic mode right now.
